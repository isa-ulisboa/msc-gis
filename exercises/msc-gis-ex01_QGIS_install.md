# Exercise 1 - QGIS Desktop 3.22  - Install and get familiar with the interface

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will set up your system to have a fully functional QGIS ver. 3.22 installation.
You will also learn to identify the different components of the interface of the software and the workflow 
to manage data and perform analysis.

## 1. Install and configure QGIS ver 3.22

QGIS is a free and open source software. It is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux operating systems. 
The latest version is 3.28, but we will use in or course the latest Long Term Release (LTR) version, 2.33. This ensures 
updates for a longer period, and a more robust (bug-free) and secure environment.

To download, go to [https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
and select QGIS 3.22 LTR for your operating system.

### **Step 1: Download and install QGIS**

To download, go to [https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
and select QGIS 3.22 LTR for your operating system

### **Step 2: Set up the interface to english**

To use standard terms for QGIS operations in english, it is better to configure the interface to that language:
- Go to Settings → Options → General (or Configurações → Opções → Geral)
- Check `Override System Locale` (or `Subsituir locale do sistema`)
- Select Translation (or Tradução) to `American English`
- Click OK
- Close and restart QGIS so the changes take effect

## 2. Documentation

The full documentation of QGIS will be a resource you will need to use often. The documentation is online, but can be
accessed from the menu Help → Help Contents
