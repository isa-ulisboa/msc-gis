# Exercise 1 - QGIS Desktop 3.28 (or newer)  - Install and get familiar with the interface

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will set up your system to have a fully functional QGIS ver. 3.28 installation.
You will also learn to identify the different components of the interface of the software and the workflow 
to manage data and perform analysis.

## 1. Install and configure QGIS ver 3.28

QGIS is a free and open source software. It is available for Windows, MacOS and 
Linux operating systems. The latest version is 3.34, but the latest Long Term 
Release (LTR) version is 2.28, which we will formally support in this course. This ensures 
updates for a longer period, and a more robust (bug-free) and secure environment. However, 
it is note expected big changes from the user point of view between teh two versions.


### **Step 1: Download and install QGIS**

To download, go to [https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)
and select QGIS 3.28 LTR for your operating system

### **Step 2: Set up the interface to english**

To use standard terms for QGIS operations in english, it is better to configure 
the interface to be in English. Make the change as follows:
- Go to Settings → Options → General (or Configurações → Opções → Geral)
- Check `Override System Locale` (or `Subsituir locale do sistema`)
- Select Translation (or Tradução) to `American English`
- Click OK
- Close and restart QGIS so the changes take effect
